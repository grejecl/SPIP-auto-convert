# SPIP-auto-convert
GUI interface for Image Metrology SPIP allowing for easy batch convertion of STM images from .mtrx to .ascii, written in Python.

--

Converts STM images from the proprietary .mtrx format into .ascii (or other - to be implemented) to be used by STM image processors other than SPIP (for example [Gwyddion](http://gwyddion.net/).  
Allows the user to select files intended for conversion to ASCII as well as different sorting options. Allows for saving of thumbnails to fascilitate easier managing of files.

Work in progress, hence messy code. But does the job.
